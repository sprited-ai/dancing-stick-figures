# Hashnode GraphQL API

A GraphQL API (Apollo Server) for publishing and managing content on Hashnode:
posts, drafts, publications, users, tags, series, and comments. This skill tells
an agent how to talk to it correctly — endpoint, auth, which operations need a
Pro plan, the limits that cause requests to fail, and where to find the full
field-level reference.

## Endpoint

| Environment | URL | Path |
|-------------|-----|------|
| Production  | `https://gql-beta.hashnode.com` | `/` (POST GraphQL here) |
| Local dev   | `http://localhost:8080` | `/graphql` |

Standard GraphQL over HTTP `POST` with a JSON body (`{ "query": "...", "variables": {...} }`).
Introspection is enabled, so the schema is browsable from any GraphQL IDE.

## Authentication

Auth uses a **Personal Access Token (PAT)**. The token must be provided via the
`HASHNODE_PAT` environment variable and passed by reference at execution time —
never inline the literal token value:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $HASHNODE_PAT" ...
```

Get a PAT from the Hashnode dashboard (Account Settings → Developer / API tokens)
and export it in the shell: `export HASHNODE_PAT=...`.

**Token handling rules — the PAT is a password.** It grants full write access to
the user's publications (publish, edit, delete):

- Never ask the user to paste the token into the conversation. If `HASHNODE_PAT`
  is unset, tell the user to export it in their shell and retry.
- Never print, echo, or log the token, and never expand it into a command string —
  always let the shell interpolate `$HASHNODE_PAT` inside the request itself.
- Never write the token into files, scripts, or commits.

- **Public reads** need no token: `post`, `feed`, `user`, `tag`, `publication`,
  `documentationProject`, `checkCustomDomainAvailability`, `checkSubdomainAvailability`.
- **Authenticated** operations need a valid PAT: `me`, `draft`, `scheduledPost`,
  and **every mutation**. A missing/invalid token returns `UNAUTHENTICATED`.

See [references/auth-and-roles.md](references/auth-and-roles.md) for the role model
(OWNER / EDITOR / CONTRIBUTOR) and the contributor review workflow.

## Pro plan gating

Some operations require the **target publication** to have an active Pro plan.
This is keyed to the publication, not the calling user. When the publication is
not Pro, the API returns:

```json
{
  "errors": [{
    "message": "Publication does not have an active Pro plan. Upgrade in your dashboard to access this via the API.",
    "extensions": { "code": "FORBIDDEN" }
  }]
}
```

**When you see this, tell the user the publication needs to upgrade to Pro in the
Hashnode dashboard. Do not retry the request — it will keep failing until the
publication is on Pro.**

Pro-gated operations:

- **All write mutations:** `publishPost`, `updatePost`, `createDraft`,
  `updateDraft`, `publishDraft`, `submitDraftForReview`, `rejectDraftSubmission`,
  `deleteDraft`.
- **Publication-scoped reads:** `publication`, `draft`, `scheduledPost`,
  `searchPostsOfPublication`, `topCommenters`. (`draft` and `scheduledPost` also
  require a PAT and authorization; the owning publication must be Pro.)

Public feed/post/user/tag reads are **not** Pro-gated.

Hashnode also has a **Growth Plan** (Pro + the AEO toolkit). It adds no new
gates to this API: `publication.aeoSettings` and `post.faq` are readable on
the same terms as their parent types, and `aeoSettings` resolves with
permissive defaults for non-Growth publications (`isEnabled` tells you
whether the publication actually has the toolkit). See "AEO fields" in
[references/queries.md](references/queries.md).

## Linking to Hashnode pages (never guess URLs)

When you need to link to a post's discussion, a comment, or a profile on
hashnode.com, build the URL from API data using these exact formats. Do not
browse hashnode.com to discover URL schemes, and do not invent paths.

| Page | URL format |
|------|-----------|
| Post discussion on hashnode.com | `https://hashnode.com/posts/<slug>/<postId>` |
| A specific comment | `https://hashnode.com/posts/<slug>/<postId>/comment/<commentId>` |
| User profile | `https://hashnode.com/@<username>` |
| Post on the author's own blog | Use the post's `url` field from the API; it already resolves the custom domain vs `<username>.hashnode.dev` |

- `<slug>` and `<postId>` are the post's `slug` and `id` from the API. **Both
  are required**; there is no id-only or slug-only form.
- `<commentId>` is the comment's `id` from the post's `comments` connection.
- Legacy paths like `/discussions/post/<id>` and `/<postId>` **404**. Never
  emit them.

Example: post `id: 6a603fb103e2cb323e7851f6`, `slug: sealed-with-a-kyss-inside-an-android-banking-rat`
→ `https://hashnode.com/posts/sealed-with-a-kyss-inside-an-android-banking-rat/6a603fb103e2cb323e7851f6`

## Rules for the agent

1. Always send `Authorization: Bearer $HASHNODE_PAT` (shell-interpolated from the
   environment, never the literal token) for `me`, `draft`, `scheduledPost`, and
   any mutation. Without it you get `UNAUTHENTICATED`. Follow the token handling
   rules in the Authentication section: don't ask for, print, or persist the token.
2. On `FORBIDDEN` + the Pro-plan message, stop and tell the user to upgrade the
   publication to Pro. Don't retry.
3. Respect page-size caps: most connections cap `first` at **100**, drafts at
   **50**. Asking for more is silently clamped.
4. Keep query depth at or below **10** — deeper queries are rejected.
5. Tag inputs use **slug** (e.g. `javascript`), max **15** per post/draft.
6. Pagination is cursor-based: read `pageInfo.endCursor` / `pageInfo.hasNextPage`,
   pass `endCursor` as the next `after`.
7. Mutations are never cached; queries may be cached for up to ~25s.
8. Build hashnode.com links from API data using the formats in "Linking to
   Hashnode pages". Never guess or browse for URL schemes.
